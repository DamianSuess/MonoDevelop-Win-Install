## Downloads

The latest builds/installers can be downloaded from

https://github.com/DamianSuess/MonoDevelop-Win-Install/releases

**MonoDevelop 7.x has a hard dependency on GTK# and MSBuild 15, so please install [GTK# for .NET](https://www.monodevelop.com/download/#fndtn-download-win) and [Visual Studio 2017 Build Tools](https://chocolatey.org/packages/visualstudio2017buildtools/15.0.26228.0) (or simply any Visual Studio 2017 edition) before running it.**

> MonoDevelop 8.x is still in active development and unstable, so there is no plan to ship artifacts for them yet.

Troubleshooting Guide
---------------------
You might try the steps to see what else we can dig out,

1. Open a MonoDevelop instance (like `C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoDevelop\bin\MonoDevelop.exe`).
1. Instead of creating/opening a project, click `Run` | `Debug Application...` menu item.
1. Set Command to `C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoDevelop\bin\MonoDevelop.exe`.
1. Set Working Directory to `C:\Program Files (x86)\MonoDevelop\bin`.
1. Click **OK**.
1. Wait till the second instance of MonoDevelop launches, switch back to the first instance, and click `View` | `Pads` | `Application Output - MonoDevelop.exe` to reveal the tracing.
1. Switch back to the second instance, and reproduce the issue.

Now the tracing should show what errors happened. From that, we can see how the installer can be improved.
